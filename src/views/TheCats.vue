      "Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips' target='_blanl' style='color: blue;'>ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations."

It is <b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments."

This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as 'salmon') and <b>not</b> just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins."

          Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.
